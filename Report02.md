### What is Axolo-for-Slack : (Axolo is complete Slack-GitHub bi-directional integration)

[Axolo](https://axolo.co/)Â opens a temporary Slack channel for every GitHub pull request or GitLab merge request. It will invite the author and its reviewers to the channel, and notify them of relevant events like code comments, GitHub Actions, Deployments, PR checks or GitLab CI/CD. Then, Axolo will archive the channel once you close or merge the pull request.

- **Issue comments & code review comments** (Slack messages in pull request channels will create issue comments in GitHub, and code review comments in GitHub will create dedicated Slack threads)
